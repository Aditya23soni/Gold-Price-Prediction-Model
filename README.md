Gold Price prediction model 
Hello! I have tried modelling a machine learning model using Random Forest to predict the value of Gold Prices using other variables like Silver prices and Stock prices etc.
The dataset is taken from kaggle.
Here is a link to the dataset

I have used a regression model named Random forest but for more accurate prediction we can used deep learning methods like NN.
